    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Alfredo Pérez-López is a dedicated composer and music arranger who believes that hard work, patience, and perseverance are imperative to his success in his chosen career.

His love for jazz, jazz-influenced music, and Japanese rock/pop/orchestral music in a place where it's not mainstream combined with his support from friends, teachers, and family in his musical performances has influenced him to continue his journey in composing music with his own unique sound.

He is currently working on music for orchestral strings and solo pieces for piano which he hopes to complete in the near future.

Alfredo works towards understanding more about music, performing for a jazz ensemble, and growing his music portfolio of scores, solo pieces, and recordings and hopes to one day have his works be listened to and performed by people with the same passion for music.

By being enrolled in his high school's music courses, he receives an education in music and performance along with doing his own studies during his free time.

Apart from music, Alfredo also enjoys many other things. He loves Asian and Mexican food, video games, webcomics, graphic novels, animated shows, studying Japanese, tea, coffee, and spending time with friends. his friends and acquaintances would consider him to be trustworthy and reliable.</p>
